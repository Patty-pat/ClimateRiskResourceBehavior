\section*{Instructions for Part 2}
\subsection*{High Probability Group Instruction}

You are in a similar decision-making situation as in Part 1.

\noindent Everything that applied in Part 1 continues to apply.

\noindent In addition, the following now applies:

\noindent Due to climate change, there is a persistent heat that causes drought in your community forest. This increases the risk of a forest fire.

\noindent If a forest fire occurs, it will break at the end of the 5th. Round out (i.e. after 10\% of the remaining trees have grown). The forest fire reduces the number of remaining trees in your community forest by 50\%.

\noindent The probability of a forest fire is 80\%.

\noindent Your group will remain the same as before.
